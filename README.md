I am wanting to create an Android app that mainly is used as a task list that has access to the phones GPS, this way it can alert the user when they are nearing a location that pertains or has the ability to complete the checklist.
If the checklist was named "Shopping list" the GPS would know that a nearby facility or store would have products listed on the checklist.
